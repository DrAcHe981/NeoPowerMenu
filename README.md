~ Sorry when my English is not the Best...

Some Days ago i saw a Nice looking Xposed Module with some great Animations and so on but it was not working anymore,
so i decided to take it and make it my own.

After some Days of working on it and sharing with my friends i thought: Okay they mean its Great so why dont share it?

So Now here is the source for ya all!

You can download the app from [Xposed Repository](https://repo.xposed.info/module/de.NeonSoft.neopowermenu)

But what is NeoPowerMenu?

Well with NeoPowerMenu you can customize your devices Power Menu as you like,
Change the colors change what is displayed and change the order!
