# NeoPowerMenu
Create Your own Power menu!
~ Sorry when my English is not the Best...

Some Days ago i saw a Nice looking Xposed Module with some great Animations and so on but it was not working anymore,
so i decided to take it and make it my own.
After some Days of working on it and sharing with my friends i thought: Okay they mean its Great so why dont share it?
So Now here is the source for ya all!

You can download the app from [Xposed Repository](https://repo.xposed.info/module/de.NeonSoft.neopowermenu)
